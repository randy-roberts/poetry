      <description>&lt;p&gt;I struggle&lt;br&gt;
Watching you struggle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire for you&lt;br&gt;
To be healthy and vibrant&lt;br&gt;
Is at odds with the reality&lt;br&gt;
Of your bodies response to&lt;br&gt;
This life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work is often&lt;br&gt;
Focused on&lt;br&gt;
Acceptance of reality&lt;br&gt;
Adjusting to the&lt;br&gt;
Discomfort of&lt;br&gt;
Dissonance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy those&lt;br&gt;
Moments&lt;br&gt;
Where I am &lt;br&gt;
Adjusted &lt;br&gt;
And my desire shifts to&lt;br&gt;
An intention to be&lt;br&gt;
A kind companion&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Diplomat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I see you&lt;br&gt;
In the midst of the negotiation&lt;br&gt;
Your stated needs&lt;br&gt;
Not being met&lt;br&gt;
The body having its own&lt;br&gt;
Point of view&lt;br&gt;
One that generally does not engage&lt;br&gt;
In negotiations&lt;br&gt;
One that places demands&lt;br&gt;
And expects compliance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind says&lt;br&gt;
This is what I want&lt;br&gt;
The body replies&lt;br&gt;
This is how it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet you continue&lt;br&gt;
Negotiations&lt;br&gt;
As every experienced&lt;br&gt;
Diplomat does&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dying Slowly by Your Side</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You do not complete me, that is my work to do&lt;br&gt;
You are a great source of joy and happiness&lt;br&gt;
And I love you&lt;br&gt;
I recall us so many years ago&lt;br&gt;
Discussing how we would love each other&lt;br&gt;
Until death&lt;br&gt;
Being young we were unaware that&lt;br&gt;
Death is a long running process&lt;br&gt;
That death is a thousand small deaths&lt;br&gt;
Each an opportunity that many take&lt;br&gt;
To exercise an option and end the deal&lt;br&gt;
We, you and me&lt;br&gt;
We made different choices&lt;br&gt;
Again&lt;br&gt;
And again&lt;br&gt;
And again&lt;br&gt;
We continue to chose to do the hard work&lt;br&gt;
One thing we got right those many years ago&lt;br&gt;
That you and I must do our own work&lt;br&gt;
If we are to have any chance of us&lt;br&gt;
So you do not complete me&lt;br&gt;
But I am motivated to do my work&lt;br&gt;
Often because of my desire to continue&lt;br&gt;
Dying slowly by your side&lt;/p&gt;</description>
