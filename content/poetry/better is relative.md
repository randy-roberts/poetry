Relief emerged today  
Seeing you   
Feeling better   
Watching your heart   
Being lighter  
Helps my heart lighten too  
  
But better is relative  
More rest is needed  
And the hope that  
Tomorrow is a better day  
  
The placid walk  
Holding your hand  
In the gentle   
Evening air  
Seeing you   
Feeling better  
Feeling better  
Let's get some needed  
Rest
