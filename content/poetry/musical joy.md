Music tickles my ears  
The advertised trio is   
Actually five people  
Two of who I'm surprised  
And delighted to see  
  
My love is enjoying the view  
As we watch from the  
Safety and coolness of   
Our car sitting on the   
Periphery of the park  
  
People parade by mostly  
Oblivious to our gaze  
The kid on the skateboard   
Who is very good  
The expecting couple  
Clearly smitten with each other   
The four dudes in their   
Out of place outfits and   
Serious demeanors  
That old couple we see  
At most music events  
  
Another talented musician   
Walks by with a friend   
Unoblivious he kindly waves  
And we return the gesture  
  
The second band is energetic   
But we are not  
We listen for a bit  
Then slowly make our way to   
Home  
  
Music is a constant   
And enjoyable way  
To stay connected to  
A heart of joy
