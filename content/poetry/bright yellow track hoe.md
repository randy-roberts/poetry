Bright yellow track hoe  
In the yard across the street  
When the place sold  
It was clear it would be torn down  
The price paid was just to get the lot  
New owners don't care for the house  
They have visions of something new  
It's driving interesting conversation  
Among the neighbors  
And I suspect I'll enjoy the process  
Watching the destruction and  
Construction
