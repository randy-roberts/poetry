My love and I sit in   
Our car parked by the Green  
We are people watching as  
First Friday art crawl happens on the  
First pleasant evening in months  
More than a decade ago when  
This event started we were   
Part of the crew who showed up  
Every month and we have continued   
To participate in a fashion that  
Respects the realities of our lives  
We watch the crowds that would have been  
Stunningly large a decade ago but are  
De rigueur these days if the weather   
Cooperates as it has today  
The people watching is good  
But even better is listening to  
My love tell me what she is seeing   
That person's mode of dress  
The child with the wild hair  
The dog that seems centered  
The vendor we have seen a thousand times  
Getting a glimpse of her   
Vision of the world is the thing  
I didn't even know I wanted   
To do tonight and yet it   
Brings me so much   
Simple joy
