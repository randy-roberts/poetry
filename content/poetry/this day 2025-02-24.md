We sit on a large rock
Overlooking the river and
The trail
It's the first warm day 
Many cyclists, runners, walkers
And mothers with their children 
Fresh from school

We sit on a large rock
For the better part of an hour
Unusual for her
Generally pushing to walk 

We sit on a large rock
Being still
Resting 
Much as you rested
Multiple times on this walk 

We sit on a large rock 
Enjoying the weather 
Enjoying the views
Enjoying our companionship 

We sit on a large rock
We listen to the 
Cardinal sing
His song as 
Ephemeral 
As our days


Randy Roberts February 24, 2025
