Strolling in the park  
She stops and says  
I need to catch my breath  
Me too   
But for very different reasons  
She is struggling physically   
And I am once again   
Caught off guard at her   
State of being   
  
We stand still a moment   
She grabs my hand and  
Tugs me forward   
Some sense of normalcy   
Restored  
  
Her body is challenging   
Her mind so sharp    
Her heart so kind  
She walks this earth with   
Care and concern for  
Each and every human  
Those she knows and  
Those she does not  
If it were up to her we  
Would all live in   
Peace, harmony, and   
Supportive community   
  
She deals with my dark view of  
Humanity and my struggles to be  
Kind with a firmness of her basic   
Commitment to treat all with  
Kindness and respect   
I often provide an opportunity   
To practice her basic instinct   
She often says she does not   
Understand my thoughts and yet  
She loves, cares, accepts, and   
Shows up with a   
Passion for life  
  
I am just grateful and happy   
To spend another day being with  
Her and seeing her smile
