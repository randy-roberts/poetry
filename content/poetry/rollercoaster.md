A rollercoaster   
Feeling poor  
Then better  
Then really worse  
This is the reality of life today  
  
The doctor visit   
So supportive  
He understands  
In a way very few do  
You challenge him  
And all his peers  
First cause no harm  
Is not easy  
With your wild biology  
  
Your ability to be  
So grounded  
Is jarring  
In the midst of  
So much discomfort   
You ask how a loved one  
Is holding up  
While so many   
Who love you   
Ask the same question   
Of you
