A friend texted
A link to an article
That helped me be
More hopeful 

An evening walk
In the rose garden 
With my love
Holding hands
Watching a mom
Playing with her very
Energetic 4 year old child
And a toddler who recently 
Learned to walk

My love is having a rough day
But the sight of those children 
And their engaged mother
Was helpful 

Sometimes just seeing 
Other people being 
Joyful 
Is enough
