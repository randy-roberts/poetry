Another day of   
Beautiful weather   
While our president   
And how cronies   
Attempt to destroy our country   
While our senators   
And members of congress   
Stand by   
The democrats wring their hands   
And the republicans either   
Provide support   
Or cower and hope they    
Aren't going to get primaried   

It's 82Â°   
On February 3    
The anti science   
Moronic republicans say    
Nothing to worry about   
On any front   

I wonder did the average   
Roman citizen   
Wonder about the   
Fall or Rome    
While it was failing   
In front of their faces
