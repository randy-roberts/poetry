She finishes her coffee
pulls on layers
and layers 
then tugs the scarf down
smiles
says “See you” 
leans over and kisses me

My world warms in her love

She walks out into the cold morning
heading for home

I sit in the coffee shop
hearing the mix of chatter 
music
work
mostly oblivious 
lost in the comfort of her love for me
