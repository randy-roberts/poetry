She says I want to sit  
Outside on the   
Longest day of the year  
Please join me  
  
So I do  
We listen to the   
Cicadas singing and   
Watch the fireflies   
Blinking out their   
Messages to each other  
Arcturus becomes the   
First star I see tonight   
And point it out to  
My love  
  
She chats about childhood   
Memories of summertime   
As the cicadas draw a   
Close to their chorus  
And the fireflies slowly  
Disappear into the darkness  
And we revel in the simple  
Joys of our moments together   
On this longest day
