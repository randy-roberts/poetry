Cathy says, I'm going to lay down  
It's noon on Thursday   
Cathy doesn't take naps  
She abhors naps  
And yet here she is lying down to nap  
I tuck her in  
I bless her   
I press my face to hers  
She thanks me  
I walk into the kitchen and  
Burst into tears  
Sobbing and crying   
My love is not well  
And I am sad
