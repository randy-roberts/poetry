It's nice to wake  
To weather cool   
Enough to sit out  
Early   
To meditate   
With a light jacket on  
  
She's tired  
Weak  
But better  
  
A call with one of  
Her oldest friends  
A visit with another  
Friend was clearly   
A good thing  
As were the calls   
With other friends   
  
Your care is so  
Well received by her  
And appreciated by me  
  
We talked this evening   
As I rubbed her  
Feet  
We are such  
Excellent lovers
