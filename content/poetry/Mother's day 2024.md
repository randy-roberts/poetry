You wear those lemon pants
And a white tee
You look relaxed 
Your great curls framing 
The simple beauty of your
Smiling face
Everything about you
Radiates
Peaceful 
Joyful
Contentment

I see how challenging 
Life is for you 
And how resilient you are
Your attitude of joyful living 
Is evident in how you
Engage with life

You are an embodiment 
Of love 
Able to live 
Because to do is to 
Be love 
To all lucky enough 
To have you in
Our lives
