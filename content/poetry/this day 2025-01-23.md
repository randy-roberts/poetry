I struggle  
Watching you struggle   
  
My desire for you   
To be healthy and vibrant   
Is at odds with the reality   
Of your bodies response to   
This life  
  
My work is often  
Focused on  
Acceptance of reality  
Adjusting to the   
Discomfort of  
Dissonance   
  
I really enjoy those  
Moments  
Where I am    
Adjusted    
And my desire shifts to  
An intention to be   
A kind companion
