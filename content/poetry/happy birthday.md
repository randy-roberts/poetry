You've probably   
Heard me say  
"Getting old sucks  
But it beats the alternative"  
  
I've decided to change  
To a more open stance  
Getting old is  
An opportunity to  
See how flexible one is  
With the realities of aging  
  
In December of 23  
I wrote a poem about aging   
That included this:  
Most of life is about getting better at things  
But how to get better at this?  
How to get better  
At this ongoing loss  
  
I've come to appreciate   
The simple joy of  
Being here now  
Not comparing with  
What was  
But appreciating how   
I formerly enjoyed things  
That are no longer available   
And that what is available   
Now is also enjoyable  
  
Today I enjoyed   
The companionship   
Of my love  
I enjoyed phone calls   
With people who care  
About me   
I enjoyed very good   
Food   
And messages from people   
All around the world  
Who took a moment to say  
Happy birthday 
  
I am happy  
And it is my birthday   
And I am enjoying   
My life
