A simple moment  
Holding your hand  
Watching the fishermen  
Standing on the low water dam  
As the water flowed strongly  
Creating standing waves   
The large white pelicans   
Floating nearby  
Some inverted then raising up  
Their heads thrown back  
And swallow unseen meals  
The blue egrets on the rocks  
In the shallows  
Looking  
Heads swiveling gaze anchored  
On unseen animals below the surface  
The steam rising from a stack at the refinery  
Is brilliant white  
The sun shining on it  
Through a break in the  
Massive dark clouds that  
Look ready to drop more rain  
Your hand hot   
Your face taut 
Your eyes bright  
Your words slow  
I know you don't feel good  
You told me so just minutes ago  
As we left the car for this   
Short walk to see the river  
Flowing so strong below  
A contrast to you  
Yet you are so full of a  
Willingness to just be here and  
Hold my hand  
So much in this single moment  
That is so wonderful to spend  
In your presence
