The hardest lesson has been that life is hard
That's only a problem when wanting it to be different than it is
But once it is clear that life is hard
Once it is accepted
The clarity of the joys
The spaces of peace
The moments of release of how it should be
Fleeting experiences of peace and tranquility
In the midst of all that is
The lesson will continue
Until the lesson is learned
