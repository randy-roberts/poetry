Remember that you don't know   
You can act with the best of intention  
and those actions can be rewarded  
or not  
Setting intention  
and acting  
are important regardless of the outcome  
Do what you feel and know to be right  
There are no guarantees  
There is only this moment to engage in life  
Act in accordance with your kind intentions  
And simply see what happens
