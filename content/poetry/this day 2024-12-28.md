A conversation   
That none wants to have  
And yet is needed   
Was had today  
I am so aware of the   
Need for compassion   
For each of us  
And my need to simply act  
Differently  
And how much that is valued  
By my love  
Makes it easy to make the    
Commitment to that change  
News years resolutions  
Don't have to wait till the  
New year  
They began today   
  
I also felt deeply  
The relaxing related  
To a change in pace due to  
No work during this holiday   
Also all the special foods  
And drinks  
All the ways I get to see a   
Change for the holidays   
Yet the feeling was   
Accompanied by the   
Acknowledgement   
That she has a very different   
Experience   
Not much changes  
Because of the constraints   
Of her health  
Her diet  
So restrictive  
That a change could mean  
Death  
Her body unable to do  
A simple trip to the city  
Her needs of normalcy   
Outweigh the social demands  
Of the holidays  
So we focus on how to enjoy   
What is available   
A stroll in the park  
A call with loved ones  
A movie at home  
A drive to see how others  
Have lit up their homes  
I appreciate that she  
Is so open to doing   
What she can  
To enjoy this life  
And that I have the   
Ongoing happiness   
To be at her side
