Grief is a signal to  
Pay attention to  
What's really going on  
  
So often it is a mask   
For the sadness of loss  
Which often is just   
A grasping for a different  
Reality that is not   
Available   
 
Grief is a signal  
To pay attention  
To my ongoing  
Battle with reality  
  
Often the recognition  
Results in a profound  
Shift  
Often to a state of appreciation  
For what was once true and   
Sadness for the real loss  
That is so often the  
Reality of life  
  
Grief is a signal  
Am I  
Paying attention
