Having coffee  
Chatting  
An easy start  
  
You decide to do   
What may have been  
A little too much  
A trait more often  
Ascribed to me  
  
But I'm the   
Beneficiary   
A wonderful desert  
Lucky me  
  
I also get listen   
As you chat with family   
And watch you sit  
And nap  
And yell at the TV  
During the game  
  
Normal  
Not even close  
But better than   
The last 3 weeks
