A good start  
Coffee  
A walk  
Breakfast   

An almost ordinary day  
With an extra side of  
Weariness and  
Weakness   
  
Ordinary until it wasn't   
The drive to the doctors  
Was hard  
Sensitivity to light  
Tired  
Oh so tired  
Then the migraine  
And the nausea   
  
Today she says  
There was a point  
Where I wondered  
Could they put me in  
A medical coma   
And wake me when it's over  
  
Considering being there  
Yourself   
And feeling that sense of  
Terror and despair   
And seeing that reflected   
In the face of my love   
Is challenging   
  
And yet here we sit  
this evening   
Relaxing and chatting   
And you are ok  
Weak, tired  
And also terrified   
That tomorrow may  
Be another day of pain
