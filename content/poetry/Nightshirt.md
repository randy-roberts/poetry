Remembering that first time

Walking in the bathroom and seeing her bra hanging on the shower curtain, drying

The memory jogged free today as I walked into the bathroom and ducked under her nightshirt hanging on the doorframe drying

The feeling of joy at being in a relationship
So fun in those early days
Still fun and so very sweet today
