You do not complete me, that is my work to do  
You are a great source of joy and happiness  
And I love you  
I recall us so many years ago  
Discussing how we would love each other  
Until death  
Being young we were unaware that  
Death is a long running process  
That death is a thousand small deaths  
Each an opportunity that many take  
To exercise an option and end the deal  
We, you and me  
We made different choices  
Again  
And again  
And again  
We continue to chose to do the hard work  
One thing we got right those many years ago  
That you and I must do our own work  
If we are to have any chance of us  
So you do not complete me  
But I am motivated to do my work  
Often because of my desire to continue  
Dying slowly by your side
