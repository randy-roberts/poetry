As you walked to the park  
With our son   
And his beloved   
Your happiness   
Radiated like a supernova   
I suspect the work crew  
Down the street  
We're hit with a wave  
Of tenderness as you  
Passed close by  
Wondering to themselves   
What is happening   
As the wave of  
Your joy swept through   
Them thinking it's just  
About the holiday tomorrow   
Unaware of the force of   
Your goodness   
Making the world a  
Better place
