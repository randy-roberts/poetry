The testing 
Went well
Today
Another tool
In your 
Exceptional limited
Medicinal arsenal
Another tool
We hope to never 
Need

I see you
Walk this 
Tightrope
Not knowing if
This action will 
Be helpful 
Or harmful
And making the
Choice to try 
Because to not
Is to accept a
Very hard reality 

I also see 
My response
Being a supporter
Engaged in the 
Discussion 
Providing needed
Help
And accepting 
Your decisions 

Your experience is
Existential
Body, mind, heart, spirit
All of affected

For me it is
Mostly emotional
Being with my
Love and seeing
What you 
Experience 

Both of us 
Exhausted
And 
Elated
