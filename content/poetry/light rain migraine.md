Light rain making   
Soft sounds on our  
Umbrella as we   
Stroll so slowly down the   
Path to the river  
  
The air is warm and sticky  
You rest hand on my arm  
I know you dislike how my  
Sweat feels in your hand  
But you are   
Focused elsewhere   
As you do when a    
Migraine is present   
  
The light rain is soft  
So unusual for here  
We look over the river  
The wild churning water  
Also unusual for here  
  
We walk slowly  
Engaged in the simple   
Pleasure of each other's  
Companionship   
  
The light rain keeps   
Falling as we arrive back  
To our car  
I watch you move slowly  
Getting settled  
My heart breaks   
Watching your  
Struggles  
My heart soars at being in  
Your presence  

The light rain keeps  
Falling
