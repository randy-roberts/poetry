Tonight we resumed  
Our simple activity  
A short walk  
Watching the   
Horizon for  
The full moon  
  
It became a   
Simple joy   
Some years ago  
That we do  
With lunar  
Regularity  
  
Last month  
We had to   
Sit it out  
You were so  
Very sick  
I wondered   
Would we every get  
To do this again?  
  
So tonight was  
One of those returns  
To normal  
  
But a normal   
That is clear  
Eyed about  
The reality of  
The fragility of  
Your beautiful life
