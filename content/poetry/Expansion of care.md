Another doctor 

I was excited to 
Hear them
Speak about this
Odd condition 
That is a big part
Of your everyday 
Reality

Speaking with some 
Humility
This doctor knows
That the profession
Do not know
Much
But that caution is
Needed to provide
Care

More challenges 
Await
Yet the care team
Expanded today
A small
Win
