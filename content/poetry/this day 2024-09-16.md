Another day 
No respite 
Your doctor makes suggestions 
That are not in line with reality 
  
So we wait for tomorrow 
And a meeting with the doctor 
Who is so attuned to you  
And the unusual needs  
Of your specific biology 
With some degree of hope  
That we might have a way forward 
That is different from 
The last last dozen days  
  
I see you 
I feel for you  
I have the simple pleasure 
Of rubbing your feet    
The act seeming so  
Small   
And yet I watch how   
You relax  
And I am happy   
To be here now   
Doing this life  
With you
