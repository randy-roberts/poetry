A liar keeps  
Lying and  
His supports   
Keep cheering   
While politicians who  
Should know better   
Scurry to the corners  
Cowering in fear  
  
It's odd at my age  
To have lived so much  
Life  
Without to much concern   
About politics  
Some would say it's   
Due to my privilege   
And they'd be right  
But I find myself   
In a position   
Where I must act  
  
My intentions for  
A society built on  
Mutual respect   
Demands my action  
So the question is  
What action matters  
  
This is a good   
Question   
I hope to find some  
Answers
