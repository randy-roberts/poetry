There is a concept of  
Embracing the dissatisfaction   
That is present in life  
Of letting go of the desire   
For life to be different that it   
Actually is  
Every time I actually   
Accomplish this task  
I come into contact with a   
Different point of view that   
Does not negate the hardness,   
Disappointment, stress, sadness but  
By the simple act of embracing reality   
I am aware of the other parts of reality   
The beauty, joy, happiness and love that  
Is often the present too  
  
Both and is real  
And shows up when I am real
