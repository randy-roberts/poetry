Trip to see   
My lovely parents  
And my sister  
Who's birthday is  
Today!  
And my niece   
A call from   
My other sister  
And my son  
And text with  
My daughter   
Then coming   
Home to   
Her  
A stroll in the   
Park  
Watching a kid  
Feeding the fish  
Was charming   
Then the storms  
Rolled in  
The thunder   
So loud   
She jumped  
A couple times  
  
A good day  
Mostly defined  
By being engaged   
People I love
