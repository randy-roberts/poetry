4:13 AM  
Awakening to the   
Phone blaring  
Something about   
Tornado warning   
  
Pants on  
Shoes on  
Shirt on  
TV on  
It's clearly   
Not good  
Looking outside  
It's clearly  
Not good  
But it passes   
And we have   
Minimal damage  
To a few trees  
While neighbors   
Contend with   
No power   
  
She's dealing   
With adrenaline   
A challenge   
For her  
My challenge   
Is to be calm  
In the face of  
Her distress   
To not be  
Another form  
Of stress  
Which I do  
Quite well  
Because I adore  
Her  
  
It made for  
A long  
Tiring  
Day
